### My First React App

[I followed this tutorial - Learn React In 30 Minutes by Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY)

### Made my changes to it

I've stylized it. Used animations, implemented keyboard shortcuts like:
- ENTER -> Add To-do
- DEL -> Clear List of To-do's

### Packages used

React
UUID (v4)
Framer-Motion

### What I learned:

- How React hooks work( useState, useEffect )
- How important animations are for any app
- More Javascript knowledge (JSX)

### What I would want to change/add:

- Animation on Clear List/Clear Completed
- Change the whole design of it (optional)
