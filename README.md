# Todo React App

### My first React "project"

I followed this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY -> Learn React In 30 Minutes by Web Dev Simplified

### Made my changes to it

I've stylized it. Used animations, implemented keyboard shortcuts like:
ENTER -> Add To-do
DEL -> Clear List of To-do's

### Packages used

React
UUID (v4)
Framer-Motion

### What I learned:

- How React hooks work( useState, useEffect )
- How important animations are for any app
- More Javascript knowledge (JSX)

### What I would want to change/add:

- Animation on Clear List/Clear Completed
- Change the whole design of it (optional)
